# Recommended inference backend per model type × platform

Pick the backend that best fits your model type and target platform. This is guidance, not a constraint — any backend that satisfies the `run_adapter` contract works.

| Model type | linux-rocm | windows-hip |
|---|---|---|
| pure VLM | vLLM/ROCm | llama.cpp/GGUF (HIP) |
| layout+VLM | ONNX `onnxruntime-rocm` (ROCm EP) + VLM server | ONNX `onnxruntime-directml` (DirectML EP, via Microsoft Olive) + VLM server |
| pipeline (MinerU2.5) | MinerU on ROCm | MinerU on DirectML/ONNX |

## Windows DirectML path (temporary compatibility fallback)

DirectML is a **temporary Windows compatibility fallback**, used only where an equivalent ROCm/MIGraphX path is not yet available — it is not a first-class backend (see the platform repo's `contracts/backend-policy.md`). For the Windows `onnxruntime-directml` path (layout models, ONNX-based pipelines), follow the AMD Ryzen AI GPU documentation, which covers DirectML EP setup and model optimization via Microsoft Olive:

## Mapping backend → `config["backend"]`

Whatever backend you choose, set `adapter/adapter_config.py::BACKEND` (or pass `--backend <name>`) and branch on it inside `run_adapter` / `_infer`. The shipped `smoke` backend is the no-GPU default — keep it as a fallback so the repo stays runnable in CI without a GPU.
